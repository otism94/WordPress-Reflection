# WordPress-Reflection
 My WordPress reflection for the Netmatters SCS training course.

## Setup
1. Import `wordpress-reflection.sql` into PHPMyAdmin, ideally as a database with the same name.
2. Set up an admin account with full priveleges for the database. Update `wp-config.php` with these details.
3. Optionally install the Composer and node dev dependencies in the `new reflection` theme.
4. Everything should be ready. If you need to access the admin panel, the username is `admin` and the password is `64UeCcUvUL`.
